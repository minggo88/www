Artists contemplate arranging distant mountains and nearby<br>trees on a flat canvas. On the contrary, shānshuǐ huà is characterized<br>by selecting specific elements from the natural scenery to depict on<br>the canvas.

Drawing or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;origami is a representative form of creative activity. People also<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sculpt figures out of clay. To create a work, one must first observe<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the subject closely and identify its distinctive features.

This was because survival and sustenance<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were paramount during that time. While there were readily<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available food sources like tree fruits, the question arises:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why did they choose to paint animals?

However, animals were different. Hunting was not<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easy, and at times, injuries or fatalities occurred during the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuit. Moreover, animals provide a variety of resources. Leather<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became clothing to ward off the cold, meat supplied nutrition,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bones were utilized as materials for crafting tools. For these<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons, animals played a vital role for prehistoric humans, leading<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the interpretation that they expressed hope for successful<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunting through cave paintings.',

In the warm spring, trees bud small shoots at the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tips of their branches.

Explain how we can delay<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>desertification.</u></strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, desertification is increasingly caused by human activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People have haphazardly cut down trees to obtain firewood<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or to clear land for farming. Additionally, deforestation occurs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as livestock graze on both grass and trees, leading to the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disappearance of forests. Desertification intensifies as forests<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grasslands diminish and overlap with drought and global<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warming. We can delay desertification by making small efforts in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our daily lives. Using public transportation, conserving electricity,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reducing disposable items can contribute to slowing down<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desertification and saving electricity. Using public transportation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results in fewer substances causing global warming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fundamentally address desertification, we must restore nature<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to its pre-desertification state. Planting trees and ensuring an<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adequate water supply to barren land can revive the soil. However,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it requires significant time, money, and effort.

Explain how seawater can be transformed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>into freshwater without salt.</u></strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desalination technology, obtaining pure water by removing salt<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particles from seawater, has seen various developments in methods.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the oldest methods involves evaporating seawater and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collecting the resulting vapor. However, this method is inefficient<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due to the significant energy required to boil seawater. Fortunately,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientists in Saudi Arabia have developed a system that utilizes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the excess heat generated during solar power generation to heat<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seawater, eliminating the need for additional facilities and making the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process more sustainable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another desalination method is reverse osmosis technology, using<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a filter (reverse osmosis membrane) to allow water to pass through<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while filtering out impurities like salt. Reverse osmosis occurs when<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a semipermeable membrane separates two solutions with different<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concentrations, and the lower-concentration solution moves towards<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the higher-concentration solution. By applying pressure to the higherconcentration solution, reverse osmosis forces the key toward the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lower concentration, effectively removing impurities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another method involves freezing seawater and obtaining clean water<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through freezing. Scientists are developing desalination technology<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using salt-tolerant plants known as halophytes. Mangroves,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a representative halophyte, are known to filter out approximately<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90% of the salt content in seawater. Researchers have created<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filters mimicking mangrove roots, and experimental results show that<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they can remove around 96.5% of the salt content. The advantage<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this technology is its simplicity in the manufacturing process and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ability to operate with small-scale devices, making it suitable for<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remote coastal areas or small villages.',
