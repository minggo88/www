Kepler established three laws of<br>planetary motion based on the observations of his teacher,<br>Brahe. To summarize the contents in two and briefly<br>explain them, they are as follows. First, planets orbit<br>around the Sun in ellipses. So, the planet has moments<br>when it gets closer to the Sun and moments when it moves<br>away. Second, the closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster<br>it moves. Kepler\'s laws are accepted as the basic principles<br>of motion in the solar system. In modern times, it is known<br>that the Sun also orbits the black hole at the center of our<br>galaxy. Moreover, our galaxy is one of the many galaxies in<br>the universe.
