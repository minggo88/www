      2: { text: 'But did you know that there are numbers that cannot<br>be expressed as fractions? These numbers are called<br>"irrational numbers." It might be a bit difficult to explain,<br>but in mathematics, an irrational number is one that<br>cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.<br>The diagonal length of a square whose width and height<br>are 1 is an example of an irrational number. It is said<br>that people in the past were also aware of the existence<br>of irrational numbers. However, in ancient Greece,<br>irrational numbers were not accepted. This was due to the<br>Pythagorean ideology that was prevalent in society at the<br>time. They believed that all things are made up of numbers<br>and that all numbers can be expressed as a ratio of<br>integers. In other words, an irrational number cannot exist.<br>When studying geometry, irrational numbers inevitably<br>appear. The Pythagorean school of thought, which did not<br>recognize irrational numbers, became a major obstacle to<br>the study of geometry. In this way, the ideas and culture<br>of an era have a great influence on the development of<br>academics.', keywords: ['But did you know', 'there are numbers', 'cannot be expressed', 'fractions', 'These numbers', 'called', 'irrational numbers', 'might be', 'bit difficult', 'explain', 'mathematics', 'irrational number', 'one that', 'cannot be expressed', 'ratio of integers', 'diagonal length', 'square', 'width and height', 'are 1', 'example', 'irrational number', 'said', 'people in past', 'also aware', 'existence', 'irrational numbers', 'However', 'ancient Greece', 'irrational numbers', 'not accepted', 'due to', 'Pythagorean ideology', 'prevalent', 'society', 'time', 'believed', 'all things', 'made up', 'numbers', 'all numbers', 'can be expressed', 'ratio of integers', 'other words', 'irrational number', 'cannot exist', 'When studying', 'geometry', 'irrational numbers', 'inevitably appear', 'Pythagorean school', 'thought', 'did not recognize', 'irrational numbers', 'became', 'major obstacle', 'study of geometry', 'this way', 'ideas and culture', 'era', 'have great influence', 'development', 'academics'], fontType: 'type3' },
