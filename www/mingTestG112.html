The airplane uses the power of the<br>engines to run along the runway, ascending into the sky swiftly.<br>Similar to how a bird\'s tail feathers help maintain balance and<br>direction, an airplane\'s tail serves a similar purpose. The airplane\'s<br>tail consists of horizontal and vertical tail fins. The horizontal tail fin<br>generates a force that lowers the rear part of the airplane, allowing it<br>to ascend, or it can produce a force that raises the front part of the<br>airplane, causing the airplane\'s nose to descend.',
